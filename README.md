1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I plan on making sure to stay disciplined in my coding by adhering to the best industry practices as well as remaining unbiased to ensure that my code or software is functional and secure. By remaining disciplined I should be able to develop functional and secure code quickly and efficiently

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Based on the clients initial asks I was able to implement them by creating certain parameters like the field could be no longer than ten characters and can also not be null. I repeated this process through the entire project with slight variations based on the parameters described by the user.

3. How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software from a place of almost no experience. I want to take all the help I can get from people who have more experience than me. I plan on learning as much as I can from these people allowing me to become a better software designer. This approach has worked for me to this point in the computer science program here at SNHU.
